# OPP Preprocessing (Optional)
> CGMap employs a width-oriented parallel propagation to localize gene associations at arbitrary distance scales in a single step, and the process can be pre-processed. Here, we provide the results obtained at the maximum distance scale of 10, which are available for download at https://zenodo.org/records/17178713. After downloading, simply copy the contents into the OPP_info directory. If you do not want to download, CGMap can also automatically process all gene associations smaller than and equal this value according to the setting of the hyperparameter OPP_layer.
